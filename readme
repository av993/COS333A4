Ameya's Contribution:
I worked on adding to the HTML files and including
the Jinga2 template engine into the HTML markup
language. I also worked on adding all the error handling
features including changing the database.py and the registrar.py
file to accept and return errors. I also worked on writing 
the code to make the cookies work.

Brian's Contribution:
I implemented the Boostrap rescaling and formatting for regdetails.html.
I added rescaling to index.html. Additionally, I also 
changed the error messages and error handling for
both index.html and regdetails.html. Finally, I prettified the py
code to remove pylint warnings.
