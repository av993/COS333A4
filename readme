Assignment 4

Ameya's Contribution:
I worked on writing the AJAX and javascript code to make sure that the table is filtered when people type into the text boxes. In addition, I also created the table.html and error.html file and worked on updating registrar.py with the updated routes. I did some initial formatting for the main page but Brian finished up the formatting that I started using Bootstrap, CSS, and HTML.

Brian's Contribution:
I implemented the Boostrap rescaling and formatting for regdetails.html.
I added rescaling to index.html. Additionally, I also 
changed the error messages and error handling for
both index.html and regdetails.html. Finally, I prettified the py
code to remove pylint warnings.
